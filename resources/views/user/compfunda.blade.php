    <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It consists of hardware components, such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, and input/output devices like a keyboard and monitor. Computers can execute a wide range of operations, from basic calculations to complex computations, and are used for tasks such as data processing, communication, multimedia, and more. They come in various forms, including personal computers, laptops, servers, mainframes, and embedded systems, each designed for specific purposes and applications.</p>
    <h2>Trivia:</h2>
    <p> Did you know who the founder of the computer is? He is Charles Babbage (born December 26, 1791, London, England died October 18, 1871, London) English mathematician and inventor who is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer.</p>
